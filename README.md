# Dart Geo

This project provides a set of utility functions for geographic computations.

You can:

* compute distance between 2 points,
* compute heading from one point to an other,
* compute a point resulting from moving a distance from origin in the specified heading.
* encode and decode a list of point according to the [Encoded Polyline Algorithm Format](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm).
